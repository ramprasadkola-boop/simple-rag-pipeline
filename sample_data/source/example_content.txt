# Python Best Practices

## 1. Code Style and Readability
- Use meaningful variable names that describe the data they hold
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

## 2. Error Handling
- Always handle exceptions explicitly, don't use bare except clauses
- Use custom exceptions for library-specific errors
- Log errors with context information
- Never silently ignore errors

## 3. Testing
- Write unit tests for all critical functionality
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Mock external dependencies in tests

## 4. Performance Optimization
- Profile code before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures for your use case
- Avoid premature optimization
- Document performance-critical sections

## 5. Documentation
- Keep README files up-to-date
- Document API endpoints and functions
- Include usage examples
- Maintain a changelog
